            <p>Hello, I'm a software developer living in Fort Worth,Texas. I am 27 years old and striving to learn more.</p>
            <hr>
            <article>
                I'm a hard working individual with a passion for,one day, creating something great that helps people in their everyday lives. <br>
                I would like to help everyone as best as possible, and for that, I'm delighted to work with people in order to realize such a dream.<br>
                But what am I outside of this? I'm foremost, a lover of the arts. Ranging from fine arts, music, and the like,I think they all hold their own beauty.<br>
                Another interest of mine would be Video Games. Stories within video games have evolved to be something truly special. I can easily recall a few games that have made me cry in recent memory.<br>


                Some other hobbies are:
                <ul>
                    <li> Exercising</li>
                    <li>Cooking</li>
                    <li>Swimming</li>
                </ul>
